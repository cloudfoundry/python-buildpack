# Cloud Foundry buildpack: Python

A Cloud Foundry [buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) for Python based apps.

This is based on the [Heroku buildpack] (https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python).

Additional information can be found at [CloudFoundry.org](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/).

## Usage

This buildpack will be used if there is a `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` file in the root directory of your project.

```bash
cf push my_app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-python.git
```

## Disconnected environments
To use this buildpack on Cloud Foundry, where the Cloud Foundry instance limits some or all internet activity, please read the [Disconnected Environments documentation](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md).

### Vendoring app dependencies
As stated in the [Disconnected Environments documentation](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager/blob/master/doc/disconnected_environments.md), your application must 'vendor' it's dependencies.

For the Python buildpack, use ```pip```:

```shell 
cd <your app dir>
mkdir -p vendor

# vendors all the pip *.tar.gz into vendor/
pip install --download vendor -r requirements.txt
```

```cf push``` uploads your vendored dependencies. The buildpack will install them directly from the `vendor/`.
